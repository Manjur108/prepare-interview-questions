==========
1.what is mean by 0 down time ?
     aplication with out down time we can follow the bule green deployment form example:i have ec2 instance inside one application----take ami backup we careate another ec2-instance then we have attach also autoscalling and load balancer we create then it is called HA
2.can you write ansible playbook?
A) ------ansible playbook ---group of task we have perform thats ---
   inventary default path ===/etc/ansible/hostes

   hostes: apache
   become: true
   tasks:
     -name: insall apache
     yum :
       name: httpd
       service

3 what blue green deployment  ?
 A) Blue is live and green in up coming version 
4.what is vpc and what subnet ?
 A) vpc-virtual private cloud 
   we can create the vpc to share the data 
   without vpc we can do anthing ex: application os level
   vpc series starts with 10,192,172 this are all private remaing Public
   we where we have create vpc must should we have select cidr_range
subnet:
=====
subnet is one of the part is vpc
we have to create subents public,private,data,subnets
by default all subnets of private so we can enabler to the public subents

5.diff between nat and igw
  igw ---public to private (or) internet to intranet --without igw we cant loging ssh server
  ng---private to public (or) intranet to internet ---by default our application we will have private subnets so ng so we give public subnet 

6.one conatiner goes down what's your immediate reaction ?
     pods will running or check thats onces after the any pod is down to describe the pod a and we have the error
     kubectl get pods 
     kubectl describe po <pod id>
     kubectl logs podname container name

7.what is git stash and git rebase ?

git stash: we ever code push to the local to remote repo but i have some work so we can the storage the tempary storage.
git rebase: at a time multipule commit by using single commit--

8.diff between pod and node ?



9.can you write any python programs?

   roles:roles means we are connecting to one service to another service we go for role. For example i have a ec2 service in ec2 service connecting to 	another service like s3, rds, eks we are attaching to role.

9. I have user how to attach role in user ?
A. You can assign an existing IAM role to an AWS Directory Service user or group. The role must have a trust relationship with AWS Directory Service. For 	more information, see Editing the trust relationship for an existing role. In the AWS Directory Service console navigation pane, choose Directories.

A. Security group is state full
15. Difference between state full and state less ?
A. state full means for example we will take security group it is state full why means, in sg have a inbound and outbound rules, so in sg we are touch to 	only inbound rules and we didn't touch outbound rules thats why sg is state full
   state less means for example we will take nacl, nack is a state less why means nacl have a inbound and outbound rules, so in nacl we are touch to inbound 	and outbound rules
